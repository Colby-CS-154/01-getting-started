This is your first submission. Read this README carefully and follow the instructions.

## Goal

- [ ] You have an account on GitHub and have installed GitHub Desktop
- [ ] You have installed VS Code and the following extensions:
  - [ ] Jupyter (Microsoft)
  - [ ] Jupyter Cell Tags (Microsoft)
  - [ ] Jupyter Keymap (Microsoft)
  - [ ] Jupyter Notebook Renderers (Microsoft)
  - [ ] Python (Microsoft)
  - [ ] Python Debugger (Microsoft)
  - [ ] Ruff (Astral Software)
- [ ] You have created more than 1 commit to your `main` branch
- [ ] You have created a new branch with a name that follows the template - `your-initials/an-ice-cream-flavor-of-your-choice`. Example: `vj/caramel-coffee`
- [ ] You have made at least 1 commit on this new branch

Following are some additional things to do if the above tasks were too easy for you, but *do not* begin them if you have not checked off any item from the above list:

- [ ] Create a [Profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme). Tell us in this README that you have completed this task.
- [ ] Create a new repository and experiment with things we have learned in class. You can read more about how to use [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop)
